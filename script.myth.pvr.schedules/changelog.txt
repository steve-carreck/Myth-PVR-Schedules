- Use Myth client to detect initial connection status instead of Myth Services API.
- Simplified initial connect timeout logic.
- Fixed possibility of memory leak in saving previous control focus method.
- Added call-sign to recording setting 'This Channel' to give context. E.g. 'This Channel (ABC)'
- Recording options separated into standard & advanced.
- Added recording option 'Recording Group'.  Add a new group either via the option - (These will remain so long as one reference exists.) Or select from a static 'Recording groups' list created in settings.  Separate with a comma, no spaces.
- Set the focus back to the previous recording list item after back from options.
